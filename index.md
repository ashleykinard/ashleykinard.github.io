Hello, my name is Ashley Kinard. I am a human being, and a technical writer by trade.

I have a real passion for technical writing â€” particularly for the software industry. I have always enjoyed writing, but never considered a career of it until a friend clued me in on the career. Making a career out of something I enjoy? Sign me up!

My first foot in the door to the world of technical writing came by what felt like sheer chance. I didn't have any past experience, and it was incredibly overwhelming to hit the ground hard. But I hit it, wobbled a bit, and kept running. I've been running hard ever since.

With this opportunity, my desire to continually develop my skills, both as a writer and technical skills, have only grown. I truly enjoy the work that I do. I love it.

I love working with developers, UI and UX designers, and quality assurance. I love producing content for product users. I love formatting documents, creating API documentation, and digging through developer code. I love writing in Markdown, pushing and merging commits, and publishing content. I love working with other writers to collaborate and create great documentation.
