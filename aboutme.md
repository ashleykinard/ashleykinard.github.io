subtitle: I'm a human technical writer.

I have a real passion for technical writing - particularly for the software industry. My first real gig in technical writing came by what felt like sheer chance. Since then, my desire to continually develop my skills, both as a writer and technical skills, have only grown.

I love staying busy. I love producing content for product consumers. I love formatting documents, creating API documentation, and digging through code.
