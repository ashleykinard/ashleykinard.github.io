## Professional Portfolio

The following are samples of work I created and contributed to the [cPanel & WHM](https://www.cpanel.net) product:

### cPanel Linked Nodes Guide

* [Live URL](https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/general-systems-administration/cpanel-linked-nodes-guide/)
* [Markdown](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/cPanel-LinkedNodesGuide)
* [PDF](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/cPanel-LinkedNodesGuide.pdf)

The creation of this particular guide was borne out of necessity to provide detailed information about cPanel's *Linked Nodes* feature to system administrators. The information was considered important, but did not have its place in any existing documentation, nor did it have a place in any related interface documentation.

### DNS Zone Manager

* [Live URL](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/dns-functions/dns-zone-manager/)
* [Markdown](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/DNSZoneManager)
* [PDF](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/DNSZoneManager.pdf)

This document describes WHM's *DNS Zone Manager* interface. I created the version 86 document and iterated on it for work done in version 96.
### Guide to the Manage2 API

* [Live URL](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/knowledge-base/guide-to-the-manage2-api/)
* [Markdown](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/GuidetotheManage2API)
* [PDF](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/GuidetotheManage2API.pdf)

This document describes the Manage2 API and its usage. This document required me to perform a substantial overhaul from its previous iteration on our old Confluence-based documentation.

### Manage2 API documentation

* [Live URL](https://docs.cpanel.net/manage2/api/manage2-api-add-licenses/)
* [Markdown](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/Manage2APIFunctions-AddLicenses)
* [PDF](https://github.com/ashleykinard/samples/blob/origin/Manage2API%20Function-AddLicenses.pdf)

This document outlines the Manage2 API *Add Licenses* function. Because our Manage2 API is not part of the cPanel & WHM product, we had to migrate this documentation to Hugo and create a specific format for its publication.

### cPanel Tutorials — Mailing Lists Video
